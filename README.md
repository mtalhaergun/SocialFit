## Tech Stack
* [ViewModel][1] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [LiveData][2] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* [View Binding][3] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* [Data Binding][4] - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* [Lifecycle][5] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
* [Navigation Component][6] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation. asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [Safe-Args][7] - For passing data between destinations.
* [Retrofit][8]- Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
* [OkHttp][9] - Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
* [Kotlin Flow][10] - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* [Coroutines][11] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [Dagger-Hilt][12] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* [Room][13] - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Glide][14] - for image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Firebase][15] - Firebase is an app development platform that helps you build and grow apps and games users love.
